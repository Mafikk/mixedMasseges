## Goal of the project
----------
Goal of the project was to create an random message each time you run a program. 

## Topic

Based on random "You seem to have an ? day" I've replied either with a funny motivational quote or a simple joke. 

## Used technologies
----------
+ Git & GitHub
+ Node.js
+ JavaScript

## Program structure
-------------------
Program is based on 4 different arrays and a fuction taking 2 as arguments. Function logs random greeting and a random sentecnce - You seem to have a bad day. Here's a joke. / You seem to have a lack of motivation. Here's a motivational quote. 

Based on which of two random sentences fuction logs either a joke or an motivational quote. 

## Lessons learned

Project was from more oriented on getting used to your own dev enviroment, Git&GitHub and Node.js debugging than on JS skills.
